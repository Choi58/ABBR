# ðŸ©» Automatic Background Recognition and Removal in Computed Radiography

> ðŸ“Œ This project reimplements the method described in the paper "Automatic Background Recognition and Removal in Computed Radiography Images" by J. Zhang and H.K. Huang (IEEE Trans. Med. Imaging, 1997).  
> **Type:** Personal Project  
> **Goal:** Replicate and understand the ABRR algorithm for background removal in computed radiography images.

This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of the ABRR algorithm, which aims to automatically recognize and remove background signals in computed radiography (CR) images caused by X-ray collimation during projection radiographic examinations. The method involves statistical analysis, signal processing, and adaptive parameter adjustments to accurately separate the image and background regions.
